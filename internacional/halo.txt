Remember those walls I built?
Baby, they're tumblin' down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make the sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
Everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I pray it don't fade away
I pray it don't fade away
I pray it don't fade away
I pray it don't fade away
Halo, don't fade away, no
Halo, don't fade away, no
Halo, don't fade away, away
I'm praying it away
I'm praying it away
Pray (eh eh eh)
Halo
